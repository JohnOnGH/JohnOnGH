Hi, I'm @JohnOnGH, I am currently interested in the intersection of emerging technologies and socio/economic systems and their impact on all our futures and on how we might, or might not, trust or digital futures.

I am the co-founder of Sezoo (https://sezoo.digital) and a protagonist for better models of digital trust using open-standards and open-source based solutions such as W3C's Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers.

I'm most active on LinkedIn (at the time I wrote this text at least) and you can see most of my posts there. I'm also on Twitter.

My details are:
