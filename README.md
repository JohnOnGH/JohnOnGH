Hi, I'm @JohnOnGH, I work in the intersection of emerging technologies and socio/economic systems, exploring their impact on all our futures. My aim is to help create a future that can be more trustworthy.

I am the co-founder of Sezoo (https://sezoo.digital) and a protagonist for better models of digital trust using open-standards and open-source based solutions such as W3C's Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers.

I'm most active on LinkedIn (at the time I wrote this text at least) and you can see most of my posts there.

My details are:
